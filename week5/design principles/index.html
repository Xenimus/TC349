      <h1>Affordance</h1>
      <h2>Good</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a></p>
      <p>Google is a website that has a great sense of affordance. The buttons look like a button, which is what its suppose to look like. Each object has a different styled look so you wouldn’t get the field form and a button confused for one another. Also the auto fill for the text is a really nice feature that adds to the affordance.</p>
      <h2>Bad</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm">Consumer Reports</a></p>
      <p>The buttons on the page are sometimes also by another button that is actually an ad. This can be sort of confusing because you’re not sure which button actually goes to the site and what button is just an ad. So you will have two objects on the same page that look very similar but both have different functions making the site confusing at times for some people.</p>

      <h1>Signal to noise ratio</h1>
      <h2>Good</h2>
      <p><a href="http://msu.edu/">MSU Website</a></p>
      <p>The MSU website has a pretty good signal to noise. It categorizes things so when you click on a certain portion of the site if give you the relative information you want and really nothing else. No having any ads on the site also helps achieve this.</p>

      <h2>Bad</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">Buzz Feed</a></p>
      <p>Buzz feed has so much noise going on in this website. If you were ever trying to read an article or browse for something on this page it would be a struggle. There is so much extra content that they give you that may have no relevance to what you are looking at or what you want.</p>


      <h1>Hick’s Law</h1>
      <h2>Good</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.threadless.com/">Threadless</a></p>
      <p>Threadless shows a good example of hicks law, for a merchandise website it’s pretty simple. Not to many buttons to get to what you need and want, giving you less choice thus making a quicker decision. A simple page design also helps with the choice of making decisions.</p>
      <h2>Bad</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.netflix.com"> Netflix</a></p>
      <p>Netflix has so many choices for movies/shows that it gives you right on the screen, making it almost impossible to pick what you should watch. The longer you look for something to watch the harder it gets to pick something and more choices that are available.</p>

      <h1>Golden Ratio</h1>
      <h2>Good</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/">Fastcompany</a></p>
      <p>This site fits into the golden ratio, the main content, navigation and side bar. All these elements have the golden ratio to them. Everything in this site fits nice into the golden ratio and makes it very appealing to people. Implementing the golden ration in design can help a website become successful.</p>
      <h2>Bad</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/spacejam/movie/jam.htm">Space Jam</a></p>
      <p>The original Space Jam website for the movie did surly not sure the golden ratio when designing this website. When navigating the site you are given a very small navigation bar that does not fit in the ratio. If they had done the golden ratio even back then this site might hold up a little bit better.</p>

      <h1>Rule of Thirds</h1>
      <h2>Good</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/">Rolling Stone</a></p>
      <p>This site uses thus rule good by putting pictures where most people would look and other less important stuff on the other points. This keeps the emphasize on the important or leading articles while having the other article off to the side and less attractive to the eye.</p>
      <h2>Bad</h2>
      <p><a href="http://mimarch.net/"> Mimarch</a></p>
      <p>This site does not use the rule of thirds at all. It seems like everything on this website is just thrown on there with no thought at all of where its going. Your eye just wants to move all around the page and not focus on key points. Does not fit into the rule of thirds grid at all. Seems like all the important information is crammed into one corner.</p>
